        Iâ€™m a Front-End and UX Developer with a strong design foundation and
        over a decade of experience building intuitive, responsive web
        applications. I began my career crafting marketing sites and
        progressively transitioned into full-stack application development. My
        recent work emphasizes building modern, performant SPAs using{" "}
        <span className="hilite">React</span>,
        <span className="hilite">Vue</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="hilite">Next.js</span>, often integrated with{" "}
        <span className="hilite">Node.js</span> and{" "}
        <span className="hilite">GraphQL</span> APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strengths lie in front-end architecture and implementation using{" "}
        <span className="hilite">HTML</span>,{" "}
        <span className="hilite">CSS/SCSS/LESS</span>,{" "}
        <span className="hilite">JavaScript</span>, and component-based
        frameworks. I also have hands-on experience with backend technologies
        including Node, Python, SQL, and MongoDB, as well as DevOps workflows in
        Linux environments.

      <p>
        Passionate about creating user-centered solutions, I collaborate closely
        with cross-functional teams and mentor others to share knowledge and
        elevate product quality.
